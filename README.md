# jamcommerce

Jam-stack e-commerce site built with next.js and sanity.io

This ecommerce store has all the basic functionality needed for an online store like Home page, categories pages, product details page, cart functionality.

Cart data is persisted so refresh page or opening in new tab will still keep cart data.

Navigation bar can be controlled from sanity studio to show only the categories you want.

No styling is done in the project as this can be used as a starter and you can theme it according to your needs.
